Kraken Time

The Prototype!

By Marty Kovach

Description

Kraken Time puts you in the role of a cranky Kraken who was slumbering at the bottom of the ocean, until a bunch of cannonballs started falling down upon you.  Upon reaching the surface you find the Spanish Armada, and the British Navy duking it for naval superiority. Tired, cranky, and immediately sick of their shit, you enter the fray looking to sink them all.  Forget "For Queen and Country", and cry "I JUST WANNA GO BACK TO SLEEP!".

##The Game

As of this moment in time Kraken Time is a WIP, with place holder rectangles for ships, tentacles, and not much else.  There are a couple of "ships" that move along the dotted paths, that you can sink with a well placed tentacle! I am hoping to continue development of this one, fleshing it out, and addining game play!


## NOTE

 Only have a iPhone to test this on, I can vouch that the build will run on iOS 8.0 and later.  For droid users, I can't vouch for anything.
